# auto-up
Send automated WhatsApp messages
        
Hello, you are using the latest version of the Auto-up tool
With this tool you can:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sending WhatsApp messages at a specific time that you specify - or immediately - to a person or to several people
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You just have to choose what suits you from the options and enjoy
It's free and always under development
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tool usage notes:
When you put more than one number, you should put it like this:
+12345678910 , +98765432101 , ......
The number must be entered with the introduction of the country.
Enter the number of messages you want to send:
It means the number of messages - different - that you want to send, 
not how many times you repeat the same message.
You must enter the time in seconds, that is, you must convert the minutes or hours according to your desire to seconds
for example, one hour = 3600 seconds and 1 minute = 60 seconds, meaning that if you want to send the message after an hour and a half, 
you must enter: 5400 seconds.
